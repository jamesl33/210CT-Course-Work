[Python]
To run the tasks completed in Python you will need to have Python 3.5.4+ installed.

	[Linux]
	All of the tasks done in Python have the interpreter defined at the top of the file therefore to run the file just run './task_name_here'
	alternatively you can run 'python3 task_name_here'

	[Windows]
	On Windows you should just be able to double click on the file you want to run. The cmd will probably close right away after the script runs successfully
	if you want to stop this simply add 'input()' at the end of the file and python will wait for input keeping cmd open. Simply press enter to close the cmd.
	Alternatively open the Python file with idle and run it.

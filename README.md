[Python]
To run the tasks completed in Python you will need to have Python 3.5.4+ installed.
	
[Linux]
All of the tasks done in Python have the interpreter defined at the top of the file therefore to run the file just run './task_name_here'
alternativly you can run 'python3 task_name_here'

[Windows]
On Windows you should just be able to double click on the file you want to run. The cmd will probably close right away after the script runs sucessfully
if you want to stop this simply add 'input()' at the end of the file and python will wait for input keeping cmd open. Simply press enter to close the cmd.
Alternativly open the Python file with idle and run it.

[C++]
To run the tasks completed in C++ you will need to have the gcc and gnu make installed. e.g on Ubuntu or Ubuntu on WSL run sudo apt install build-essential
	
[Linux]
Run 'make' in the task directory which will compile the included code into an executable file named after the task e.g task1, task2
to run the program simply run './compiled_task_name' e.g './task1'
To remove the compiled executable and object files simply run 'make clean'

[Windows]
I have not tested my programs on Windows however it should be the same case as running it on Linux if you use the WSL. I do not know how to correctly compile
these programs to run nativly on Windows.
